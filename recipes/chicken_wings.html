        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>My family and I love chicken wings, especially during football season. I just got tired of spending so much money on wings for our party that I decided to whip up my own version of Wing Stop's® lemon pepper chicken wings. The ending result was an empty platter and pleased bellies.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups oil, or as needed</li>
                <li>2 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon lemon pepper seasoning (such as McCormick®)</li>
                <li>12 chicken wings</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Stir olive oil and lemon pepper together in a bowl.</li>
                <li>Fry the chicken wings in hot oil until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 8 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Toss hot wings with olive oil mixture to coat.</li>
            </ol>
